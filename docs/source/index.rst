Mission
=======

.. include:: about/_mission.rst

Features
========

* **unified API** for ML/AI with time series, for model building, fitting, application, and validation
* **support for a variety of learning tasks** including :ref:`forecasting <forecasting_ref>`, :ref:`time series classification <classification_ref>`, :ref:`regression <regression_ref>`, :ref:`clustering <clustering_ref>`.
* **composite model building**, including pipelines with transformations, ensembles, tuning, reduction
* interactive user experience with **scikit-learn like interface conventions**

Technical specification
=======================

* In-memory computation of a single machine, no distributed computing
* Medium-sized data in pandas and NumPy based containers
* Modular, principled and object-oriented API
* Using interactive Python interpreter, no command-line interface or graphical user interface
